To change this, you should override\n this function so it returns a different value.\n We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert\n instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless\n conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20\n applications.\n Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\n This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\n by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\n these events, as it isn't required by the specification."

To change this, you should override this function so it returns a different value. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification.\",\"errors\":{\"ERC20InsufficientAllowance(address,uint256,uint256)\":[{\"details\":\"Indicates a failure with the `spender`\\u2019s `allowance`.

Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance. This is not required by the EIP. See the note at the beginning of {ERC20}. NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance is the maximum `uint256`. Requirements: - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `value`. - the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least `value`.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"src/modules/blockchain/contracts/ERC20.sol\":\"ShockiToken\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":100000},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/draft-IERC6093.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x60c65f701957fdd6faea1acb0bb45825791d473693ed9ecb34726fdfaa849dd7\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://ea290300e0efc4d901244949dc4d877fd46e6c5e43dc2b26620e8efab3ab803f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmcLLJppxKeJWqHxE2CUkcfhuRTgHSn8J4kijcLa5MYhSt\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xc3e1fa9d1987f8d349dfb4d6fe93bf2ca014b52ba335cfac30bfe71e357e6f80\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://c5703ccdeb7b1d685e375ed719117e9edf2ab4bc544f24f23b0d50ec82257229\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmTdwkbQq7owpCiyuzE7eh5LrD2ddrBCZ5WHVsWPi1RrTS\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xc6a8ff0ea489379b61faa647490411b80102578440ab9d84e9a957cc12164e70\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://0ea104e577e63faea3b69c415637e99e755dcbf64c5833d7140c35a714d6d90c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmau6x4Ns9XdyynRCNNp3RhLqijJjFm7z5fyZazfYFGYdq\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xaa761817f6cd7892fcf158b3c776b34551cde36f48ff9703d53898bc45a94ea2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://0ad7c8d4d08938c8dfc43d75a148863fb324b80cf53e0a36f7e5a4ac29008850\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmcrhfPgVNf5mkdhQvy1pMv51TFokD3Y4Wa5WZhFqVh8UV\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x493033a8d1b176a037b2cc6a04dad01a5c157722049bbecf632ca876224dd4b2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6a708e8a5bdb1011c2c381c9a5cfd8a9a956d7d0a9dc1bd8bcdaf52f76ef2f12\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmax9WHBnVsZP46ZxEMNRQpLQnrdE4dK8LehML1Py8FowF\"]},\"src/modules/blockchain/contracts/ERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xeed66aa05b15e0d45543926369f845444cc3b071b80f6ac26d076c146c544b47\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://013bd030df168d2da1b7a8a31ce58a9dede0f98dee431b1ed51204b1c97d4ed2\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmdkmPgieN8485duxyu9Jr5EW3EBVNq2X9gE6nSnT9eo71\"]}},\"version\":1}"
